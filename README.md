# CTNSCamp
The repository of the Camp at the Center for Translational Neurophysiology of Speech and Communication (CTNSC). During this Camp we'll learn about NeuroAI topics and go through group projects.

## What
NeuroAI course: Learning at the intersection between neuroscience and artificial intelligence.
Three main modules:
- Computational Neuroscience (https://compneuro.neuromatch.io/tutorials/intro.html)
- Deep Learning (https://deeplearning.neuromatch.io/tutorials/intro.html)
- NeuroAI (https://neuroai.neuromatch.io/tutorials/intro.html)

Project:
"Building a deep learning model for speech acquisition in the brain"
- Learning about speech acquisition in the brain
- Reason about model selection and problem solution
- Reason about hierarchical learning and modelling in neuroscience and deep learning
- Implement a solution in Python
- Prepare a presentation poster to submit at the Cognitive Computational Neuroscience Conference (https://2024.ccneuro.org)

## When
From November 2024 to October 2025
- Course: 2 days a week. 1 hour per day : 6-7 pm
- Project: 4/5 full days (Saturdays). One day every 2/3 months.
